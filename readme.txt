MODDED EXES ARE REQUIRED FOR WORK: https://github.com/themrdemonized/STALKER-Anomaly-modded-exes

DLTX OR FDDA EXES ALSO WORK

Dynamic Anomalies Overhaul 0.6.3
Written by demonized, 2022
Based on work by DoctorX and Eugenium Hazardous Anomalies
Features
	Creating anomalies at the start of level after emission/psi-storm and removing anomalies after emission/psi-storm instead of just disabling them, allowing for truly dynamic generation
	Anomalies behaviour:
		enable/disable with randomized periods, duration and cooldowns for every single anomaly
		behaviour if actor is near an anomaly (wip)
		behaviour on hit (wip)
		articles about new anomalies (wip)
   	Spawning artefacts in new anomaly zones
 	Enhanced behaviour of usual anomalies

New anomalies:
	- "Darkness" - typical one shot anomaly, very omnious looking, met only on north locations. Special behaviour - has a chance to spawn poltergeist in the proximity of player
	- "Flash" - bubbly temporal anomaly, which doesnt hurt the player by itself, but travels him forward in time
	- "Ghost" - Green bubble anomaly that moves along the fixed path
	- "Liquid gold" - Yellow acid pool like anomaly, special behaviour - drains thirst and some stamina
	- "Green dragon" - Acid field anomaly, special behaviour - 50% reduction of speed near anomaly
	- "Mefistotel" - Strange flower-like anomaly
	- "Net" - Fountain of particles
	- "Point" - Ball lightning anomaly, special behaviour - charges batteries of active items if near actor
	- "Radar" - Psy anomaly, has weak but unavoidable psy field which hurts player along with main hit
	- "Press" - Gravitational anomaly, provides 50% resistance to bullet damage if near actor

Enhanced old anomalies:
	- Electra - has electric field that damages player and equipment
	- Gravitational anomalies - emits disturbance in gravitational field, causing player to tremble and shake
